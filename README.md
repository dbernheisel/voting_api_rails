# Voter API

## Description
[ERD Model](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/189a7898-8bc2-445b-8711-91b9cbcf7f0e)

This is a Voter API application that tracks voters, candidates, and votes that voters cast with some light validations. Really, don't use this. I'm just practicing Ruby on Rails.

## Usage
Eventually, just clone the repository and run the rails server and look at the site!

`rails server`
then probably go to http://localhost:3000

## TODO
- [x] Create ERD Model
- [x] Setup associations in the db
- [ ] Provide V in M**V**C
- [ ] Create skeleton controllers.
